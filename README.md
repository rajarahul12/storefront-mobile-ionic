## Component Interaction Design
IBM Mobile Foundation is positioned as the mobile gateway to the StoreFront providing mobile app and device security over and above the Storefront user authentication and authorization.  All calls to from the mobile app to the Storefront backend services are made via Mobile Foundation to exploit this comprehensive security. The Storefront backend services are registered with Mobile Foundation as confidential clients with appropriate allowed scopes to enable them to invoke the Send Push Notifications API.

### Pre-requisites
- Ionic CLI Version 5.4.16 - https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli
- Storefront server components installed and running - microservices, dependent DBs, IBM Mobile Foundation
- IBM Mobile Foundation CLI - https://www.npmjs.com/package/mfpdev-cli

### Usage
1. Ensure that the Storefront services including Mobile Foundation services are deployed and running
2. Clone this repo locally and change current working directory to storefront-mobile-ionic
```
git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-ref-storefront/storefront-mobile-ionic.git
cd storefront-mobile-ionic
```
3. If you are setting up Storefront services for the first time or have reset it then you will need to configure Mobile Foundation services for this StoreFront mobile application as follows: -
    - This StoreFront Mobile Application is designed to receive Push Notifications about the progress of StoreFront order shippments. To enable Mobile Foundation Push Notifications service for this application you must configure the service for Push Notification Credentials (FCM, APNS).  Edit `mfpconfig/app_config.json` file and update it for these credentials under json object `services.push.settings`.  To know more about what these settings and credentials are about lookup https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/notifications/sending-notifications/#setting-up-notifications 
    - All other required configurations are already preset into `mfpconfig/app_config.json` file
    - To enable push notification on Android remember to replace `google-services.json` into the directory `ionic` 
    - Edit `mfpconfig/server_config.json` and input the endpoint url, port and admin credentials for the Mobile Foundation Server
    - Save `mfpconfig/server_config.json` and `mfpconfig/app_config.json` files
    - From the root of this repo clone i.e. from the directory storefront-mobile-ionic run the following command
      ```
      mfpdev app register
      ``` 
      and you must see the following output
      ```
      Registering to server:'http://<mobile foundation endpoint url>:<port>' runtime:'mfp'
      Registered app for platform: android
      Registered app for platform: ios
      ```
    -  Edit `adapter/BlueAuthLogin/config.json` and input the token endpoint url, client id and client secret of the storefront microservice
   - Save `adapter/BlueAuthLogin/config.json` file
   - From the directory `adapter/BlueAuthLogin` run the following command to deploy an Blue Auth Adapter
   		- ```mfpdev adapter deploy```
      	- ```mfpdev adapter push```
  		and you must see the following output
   	   ```
     	locahost:BlueAuthLogin user$ mfpdev adapter deploy
		Verifying server configuration...
		Deploying adapter to runtime mfp on http://localhost:9080/mfpadmin...
		Successfully deployed adapter
		user:BlueAuthLogin user$ mfpdev adapter push
		Verifying server configuration...
		Pushing adapter configuration to runtime mfp on http://localhost:9080/mfpadmin...
		Successfully pushed adapter configuration
      ``` 


Now all the storefront services are up and running and Mobile Fountation is also configured.

4. Edit `ionic/config.xml` file and update the element <mfp:server runtime="mfp" url="<url for mobile foundation server" /> for the url endpoint of the Mobile Foundation server
5. From a command-line window, navigate to the project's root folder and run the commands:
    - `cd ionic` - to navigate to application folder
    - `ionic cordova platform add ios` or `ionic cordova platform add android` - to add a platform.
    - `ionic cordova run` - to run the application.

6. Run the application to view the catalog, make an order and review the user profile.
